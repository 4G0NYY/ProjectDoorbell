# THIS IS NOT FOR GENERAL USE

Again, this is just a project which I'm doing because one of my superiors asked me to. I do this purely for fun, so no support will be given.

**IF I'M FEELING GOOD** I might check issues every now and then. No guarantees though ;)

And yes, I'm aware that if you go to "commits", somewhere you'll see a .env-File, this is only the template though, so have fun with it <3
